                        by Luke Marzen. Uses a ESP32 microcontroller with wifi and a 7.5-inch E-paper display. 
                        Software uses Transitapp API which offers real-time bus data. 
                        Would display busses near my home but could expand to adapt to current location.

                    Using a microcontroller and USB HID libraries to support the controller input. 
                    Another possible route would be to emulate pre-existing and popular gamepads such as the Xbox 360 controller.
                    For the software, I am planning on using JS Gamepad API to create a simple tester to check controller latency, deadzones etc.
