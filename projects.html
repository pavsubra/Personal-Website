                    Designed an ALU processor by utilizing logic components such as registers, decoders and finite state
                         machines to perform logic or arithmetic operations on 8-bit values
         • Modeled each logic component through Verilog modules and verified correct behaviour with testbench
             simulations
         • Successfully validated the design by analyzing output waveforms from the top-level circuit using Vivado
             simulation tools

                    Using a microcontroller and USB HID libraries to support the controller input. 
                    Another possible route would be to emulate pre-existing and popular gamepads such as the Xbox 360 controller.
                    For the software, I am planning on using JS Gamepad API to create a simple tester to check controller latency, deadzones etc.
